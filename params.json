{"name":"ramalloc","body":"**ramalloc** is a parallelized, amortized-constant time allocator for objects smaller than a hardware page. it exhibits deterministic performance characteristics, which is necessary for soft real-time applications. it also reduces memory fragmentation, which is important for long-running processes. *ramalloc* is designed for game and interpreter development but should be useful for other applications as well. *ramalloc* is also parallelized; there is no global resource that requires serialized access.\r\n\r\nplease read the [README][1] file for details about project status and usage.\r\n\r\nfeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* deterministic performance (amortized-constant time).\r\n* low fragmentation.\r\n* limited waste (a 4 byte object can have less than 1 byte of overhead).\r\n* coexists with a supplementary heap allocator.\r\n* query any valid base pointer to determine source allocator, if any.\r\n* returns unused memory to the system.\r\n* parallelized.\r\n\r\nrequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* a C89 compiler (to-date, only MSVC 2010 and GCC 4.4.4 have been tested).\r\n* [CMake][2].\r\n* [trio][3], which is already included for you in the source distribution.\r\n* support for threads.\r\n* Windows or Linux, though other ports should require little effort.\r\n\r\nlicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n*ramalloc* source code is provided under the *New BSD License*.\r\n\r\nthis means that you are free to use *ramalloc* for any purpose you see fit, as long as you give proper credit for my work.\r\n\r\nsee [the LICENSE file][4] in the source distribution for more details.\r\n\r\n-----\r\ncopyright &copy; 2011, michael lowell roberts.  \r\nall rights reserved.  \r\nlicensed under the [*New BSD License*][4].\r\n[1]: https://github.com/fmrl/ramalloc/blob/master/README.markdown\r\n[2]: http://www.cmake.org\r\n[3]: http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/trio/\r\n[4]: http://github.com/fmrl/ramalloc/blob/master/LICENSE.markdown\r\n##fmrl","tagline":"a parallelized, amortized-constant time allocator for objects smaller than a hardware page.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
